      "kickoff_prompt": "Feature brief (BL-0008): Every sprint must include at least one sprint gate task that validates sprint goals and provides evidence-friendly exit criteria. Sprint close should warn/block when gates are missing or incomplete.\n\nGoal:\n- Define gate semantics (task_type, acceptance criteria requirements, evidence paths, relationship to release gates) and how enforcement works in lint/status/close.\n\nFiles likely to change:\n- cli_plan/v1_cli/CLI_CONTRACT.md\n- cli_plan/ph_spec/ph/sprints/contract.md\n- cli_plan/ph_spec/ph/releases/contract.md\n\nOutputs (must be explicit after this task):\n- Exact definition of a sprint gate task:\n  - `task_type: sprint-gate`\n  - expected `session` value (from I07-TTYPE-0001 mapping table)\n- Deterministic gate-doc requirements that can be implemented as string/heading checks, for example (choose exact rules and write them down):\n  - Gate tasks MUST include the literal `Sprint Goal:` in `validation.md` (or another exact file, but specify which).\n  - Gate tasks MUST mention `secret-scan.txt` (already required by pre-exec lint globally; keep it explicit in gate docs).\n  - Gate tasks MUST reference the sprint plan path `sprints/current/plan.md` (or a relative link) so the goal can be traced.\n- Close semantics:\n  - default: block `ph sprint close` when no sprint-gate tasks exist or when any sprint-gate task is not `done`\n  - if override exists: exact flag name + messaging\n- Release relationship:\n  - how sprint gates relate to `release_gate` tasks when `release` is active\n\nBehaviors to implement/adjust (contract/spec):\n- Sprint must have >=1 task with `task_type: sprint-gate`.\n- Gate tasks must meet the deterministic gate-doc requirements defined above.\n- Define `ph sprint close` behavior per the explicit semantics above.\n\nVerification steps:\n- Doc review for consistency.\n\nAcceptance criteria:\n- Contract specifies sprint-gate semantics and gate-doc requirements as concrete markers/strings/headings.\n- Close behavior is explicit (block vs override) and implementable without additional decisions.\n",
