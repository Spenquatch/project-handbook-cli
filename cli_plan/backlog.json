      "scope": [
        "Add `ph adr add` to scaffold a new ADR Markdown file under `PH_ROOT/adr/` with correct filename/id alignment and required front matter.",
        "Add ADR-focused validation (either `ph adr validate` or expand `ph validate`) to enforce required headings/structure and stronger invariants (e.g. uniqueness, supersession consistency)."

      "notes": [
        "This conflicts with the current v1 ADR contract statement: humans create/edit ADRs directly and there are no `ph adr ...` commands.",
        "Implementation MUST preserve the v1 rule that `ph` does not execute repo-local code at runtime; ADR scaffolding/validation must be internal to the installed CLI."

        "CLI refuses to overwrite an existing ADR unless `--force` is provided."
