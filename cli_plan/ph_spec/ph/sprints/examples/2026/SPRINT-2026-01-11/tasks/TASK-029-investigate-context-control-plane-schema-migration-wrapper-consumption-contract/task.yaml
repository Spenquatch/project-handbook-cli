owner: @spenser
status: done
story_points: 3
depends_on: []
prio: P2

acceptance:
  - Create and complete `project-handbook/features/v2_context-control-plane-schema/decision-register/DR-0001-context-control-plane-migration-and-consumption-contract.md` (Option A/B + evidence + explicit operator approval request; keep DR as `Proposed` until approved).
  - `project-handbook/features/v2_context-control-plane-schema/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` updated with the selected snapshot query shape, federation approach, and consumer contract.
  - `project-handbook/features/v2_context-control-plane-schema/implementation/IMPLEMENTATION.md` updated with an execution-ready migration plan (DB schema deltas, rollout sequencing, invariants, validation approach).
  - Evidence captured under `project-handbook/status/evidence/TASK-029/` and referenced from DR-0001.
