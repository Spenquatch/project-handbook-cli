acceptance:
  - `ph/decision-register/DR-0005-router-supergraph-consumption-from-cosmo.md` completed (Option A/B + evidence + recommendation) and ends with an explicit operator/user approval request; keep DR as `Proposed` until approval.
  - `ph/features/v2_schema-publishing-and-composition/implementation/IMPLEMENTATION.md` updated with an execution-ready Router consumption plan (auth material, refresh/polling model, and the exact v2 config files that will change).
  - Evidence captured under `ph/status/evidence/TASK-003/` (repo inspection outputs referenced by DR-0005 and the execution-ready plan).
