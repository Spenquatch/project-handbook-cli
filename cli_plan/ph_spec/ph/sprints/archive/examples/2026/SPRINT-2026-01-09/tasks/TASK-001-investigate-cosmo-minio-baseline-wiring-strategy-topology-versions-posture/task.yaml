title: Investigate: Cosmo+MinIO baseline wiring strategy (topology, versions, posture)
feature: v2_registry-cosmo-minio-required
lane: registry/discovery
decision: DR-0003
session: research-discovery
owner: @spenser
status: done
story_points: 3
depends_on: [TASK-005]
prio: P2
due: 2026-01-16
acceptance:
  - `ph/decision-register/DR-0003-cosmo-minio-baseline-topology.md` completed (Option A/B + evidence + recommendation) and ends with an explicit operator/user approval request; keep DR as `Proposed` until approval.
  - `ph/features/v2_registry-cosmo-minio-required/architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md` updated with the selected Cosmo stack inventory (services, image tags, databases) and internal-only exposure posture.
  - `ph/features/v2_registry-cosmo-minio-required/implementation/IMPLEMENTATION.md` updated with an execution-ready plan (exact v2 wiring points, required env/secrets, bucket init approach, smoke probes).
  - Evidence captured under `ph/status/evidence/TASK-001/` (repo inspection outputs referenced by DR-0003 and the execution-ready plan).
