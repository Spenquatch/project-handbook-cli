Remediation hints:
- Ensure the v2 stack is up: make v2-up (or docker compose -p tribuence-v2 -f infra/compose/docker-compose.v2.yml up -d)
- Check Router logs: docker compose -p "tribuence-v2" -f "/Users/spensermcconnell/__Active_Code/oss-saas/v2/infra/compose/docker-compose.v2.yml" logs -f --tail=200 apollo-router
- If Traefik ports are overridden, run with: V2_SMOKE_ROUTER_URL=http://router.local:<port>/
