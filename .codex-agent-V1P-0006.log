You are the background Coding Agent for a single strict-parity task.

TASK
- ID: V1P-0006
- Title: Parity: `make help backlog` / `make help-backlog` → `ph help backlog`
- Scope guardrail: ONLY work on V1P-0006. Do not touch other task IDs.

CHECKLIST SUBSECTION (from cli_plan/PARITY_CHECKLIST.md)
### Help
- `make help backlog` / `make help-backlog` → `ph help backlog`
  - Preconditions: none
  - Command: `ph --root <PH_ROOT> help backlog`
  - Outputs to verify: (none; stdout only)

LEGACY REFERENCE
- Legacy repo (canonical): /Users/spensermcconnell/__Active_Code/oss-saas/project-handbook
- Invoke legacy behavior with: `pnpm make -- <target>`

DISPOSABLE PH_ROOT (required)
- Create a disposable copy of the legacy repo into a fresh temp dir and use that as PH_ROOT for BOTH legacy and `ph` runs.
- Prefer rsync copy that excludes `.git`, `node_modules`, `.venv`, `.project-handbook`.

COMMANDS TO RUN (exact; adjust only if needed)
1) Create PH_ROOT and copy legacy repo:
- LEGACY_SRC="/Users/spensermcconnell/__Active_Code/oss-saas/project-handbook"
- PH_ROOT="$(mktemp -d -t ph-parity-V1P-0006-XXXXXXXX)"
- rsync -a --delete --exclude '.git' --exclude 'node_modules' --exclude '.venv' --exclude '.project-handbook' "$LEGACY_SRC/" "$PH_ROOT/"

2) Install deps once in PH_ROOT for legacy runs:
- (cd "$PH_ROOT" && pnpm install --frozen-lockfile)

3) Capture legacy stdout (both spellings):
- (cd "$PH_ROOT" && pnpm make -- help backlog) > /tmp/legacy-help-backlog.txt
- (cd "$PH_ROOT" && pnpm make -- help-backlog) > /tmp/legacy-help-backlog-dashed.txt

4) Capture `ph` stdout:
- uv run ph --root "$PH_ROOT" help backlog > /tmp/ph-help-backlog.txt

5) Compare outputs:
- diff -u /tmp/legacy-help-backlog.txt /tmp/ph-help-backlog.txt

OUTPUTS TO COMPARE
- Stdout byte-for-byte: `/tmp/legacy-help-backlog.txt` vs `/tmp/ph-help-backlog.txt`
- Note: the dashed legacy form may differ only because pnpm echoes argv; use it as a secondary reference.

ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA
- `ph --root <PH_ROOT> help backlog` stdout matches legacy `pnpm make -- help backlog` stdout (byte-for-byte) when run against the same PH_ROOT copy.
- If mismatch: update implementation and add/adjust deterministic pytest tests that lock parity.
- Run: `uv run ruff check .` and `uv run pytest -q` before reporting completion.

BOOKKEEPING (must follow)
- Update `cli_plan/tasks_v1_parity.json` for V1P-0006:
  - set `status: done`
  - add `completed_at: <UTC ISO timestamp>`
- Fill in the already-appended session log stub at the end of `cli_plan/session_logs.md` for V1P-0006.
  - Keep it appended at end; do NOT insert it earlier in the file.
  - Ensure Inputs reviewed includes: `cli_plan/AI_AGENT_START_HERE.md`, `cli_plan/tasks_v1_parity.json (task V1P-0006)`, `cli_plan/PARITY_CHECKLIST.md`, `cli_plan/v1_cli/CLI_CONTRACT.md`.

COMMIT (required)
- Commit exactly one atomic commit for this task:
  - message: `Parity: V1P-0006 help backlog`
  - Do NOT add/commit any `ph-parity-*.done` marker files or other untracked artifacts.
  - Prefer: `git add cli_plan/tasks_v1_parity.json cli_plan/session_logs.md src/ph/help_text.py tests/test_help_topics.py` (plus any other required code/test files for this task).

REPORT BACK WITH
- commands executed (exact)
- files changed (exact)
- verification evidence (what matched / what changed)
- the exact commit hash created
- any follow-ups / discovered drift

COMPLETION SENTINEL (required)
- Print exactly one line at the end: `DONE: V1P-0006 — <short summary>`
- Write a marker file (untracked): `ph-parity-V1P-0006.done`

**Planning command execution**

I need to run some commands like `uv run ruff check .` and `uv run pytest -q`, and there's probably a `uv run` command too. I'll keep a log of executed commands for accuracy, focusing on the major ones. First, I’ll check the repository structure for an AGENTS.md file, considering the user’s instructions. I’ll use `find` and the `functions.shell_command` to run commands, putting together a plan with about 5-6 steps to keep everything organized. Let's get started!
Plan update
  → Scan current help backlog implementation
  • Run legacy vs ph parity diff
  • Implement fixes and tests
  • Run ruff and pytest verification
  • Update bookkeeping and commit
  • Write untracked done marker

thinking
**Executing commands for tasks**

I'm planning to run some commands to check on AGENTS, inspect files, and locate the help backlog. This involves using commands like `ls`, `find AGENTS.md`, and searching for "help backlog" with `rg`. It seems efficient to parallelize these tasks with `multi_tool_use.parallel` so I can execute multiple shell commands at once. This way, I can gather the information more quickly and efficiently.

**Planning version control and commands**

I see that there are existing marker files like `ph-parity-V1P-0002.done` in the repository, indicating previous tasks. For this task, I’ll create a new marker file called `ph-parity-V1P-0006.done`, which will be untracked. I need to check for an entry in the .gitignore and ensure that `git status` reflects this. Next, I’ll examine `src/ph/help_text.py` regarding the backlog issue and compare outputs with the legacy version. Achieving byte-for-byte parity with legacy outputs is crucial, so I'll run the necessary commands to establish a baseline.
thinking
**Inspecting help topics and comparisons**

I think it's important to inspect the CLI contract concerning help topics, even if it may not be strictly necessary. I must run legacy comparisons, but first, I'll confirm that pnpm and dependencies are installed in my environment, which seems likely. I need to follow the exact commands for this process. So, I’ll view `src/ph/help_text.py` and analyze the help logic in the CLI. I'll also read relevant files using commands like `sed`, ensuring I capture the right sections for parallel comparison. Let's get started!

thinking
**Executing commands for setup**

I'm planning to create PH_ROOT, copy the legacy repo, and install dependencies by executing the necessary commands in a shell. Since the tool runs in a non-interactive shell, I'll need to set variables carefully because they won't persist across calls. I can run a single zsh script to perform all the steps while capturing the outputs and comparing them. I'll also ensure to store the PH_ROOT path for later use in a temporary file to keep things organized.
thinking
**Running setup commands**

I’m planning to execute a series of commands that include setting up a legacy source and creating a temporary directory for PH_ROOT. This involves using `rsync`, and I want to ensure I capture the PH_ROOT path for later. Now, I’m wondering about adding an extra command for echoing PH_ROOT. Is that necessary? I could possibly export it, but I might also capture it directly from the command output. Ultimately, I think it’s best to include all required commands, even the extra echo, to stay compliant.
thinking
**Creating persistent environment for commands**

I'm figuring out how to run my shell commands effectively. Since the shell command returns stdout, I realize that if I run each command separately, the variable from `mktemp` won't persist. I could write the PH_ROOT into an environment file or rerun `mktemp` each time, but the requirements say both legacy and PH runs should use the same PH_ROOT. So, I'll opt for a single script that incorporates everything, including the `diff` command, while ensuring I use `set -euo pipefail` for better error handling.
thinking
**Executing steps with PH_ROOT**

I'm setting up PH_ROOT using `mktemp` to create a temporary directory. Next, I'll sync files with `rsync` and run `pnpm install` within that directory. I'll also execute a command for help and redirect its output to a text file. After that, I'll run a different command to gather help info related to PH and output it to another file. For tracking purposes, I'll capture the PH_ROOT path using `echo` at the end. I know they want a disposable copy, so I'll make sure each run creates a fresh PH_ROOT. Let's get this executed!

thinking
**Adjusting help text**

I’m noticing that the diff shows only content for help text needs to match the legacy version exactly. It seems pretty straightforward to adjust `src/ph/help_text.py` to align with the legacy format, particularly using commands like `make backlog-add`. 

The mapping indicates that the help output should mimic the legacy `make help`, and I’ll apply that format for the backlog topic too. I'll also account for spacing differences in the current backlog help command lines and ensure it matches the legacy layout. Lastly, I need to add a newline at the end.
thinking
**Implementing backlog help updates**

I see that the diff shows the last line about "make backlog-stats" lacks a trailing newline, but it seems likely that the file does include one. I’ll check this by running a command after the needed changes. Additionally, I plan to add an expected stdout check for the backlog, similar to other topics.

I'll create a helper function called `_expected_help_backlog_stdout` and test it. The acceptance criteria indicate we need deterministic pytest tests, so I'll name the test `test_help_backlog_stdout_matches_legacy_pnpm_make_help_backlog`. I'll make sure to use a minimal `ph` root and legacy package, ensuring it asserts exact bytes.

Also, it seems I need to update the `TOPICS` in help_text and note the backlog help output structure, especially with the preamble. Let’s implement all these modifications correctly!
thinking
**Aligning package version and help text**

I realize our tests use the helper `_write_legacy_like_package_json` to create a `package.json` with the name "project-handbook" and version "0.0.0." This is important as it ensures the pnpm make preamble prints correctly. In our parity run, we might have used a real legacy repository with an actual version, but for testing, 0.0.0 is fitting.

I’ll make sure our changes to `help_text` mimic the legacy output lines we observed. Note that the preamble includes "> make -- help backlog" from `_format_pnpm_make_preamble`, which seems fine.

I'll go ahead and patch `src/ph/help_text.py` for the backlog topic to use make, and I'll also update the `DEFAULT_HELP` listing lines to reflect these changes. Let's patch this through `apply_patch`.

thinking
**Examining test function logic**

I'm exploring how to use `python -c` to check representations or using `tail -c`. I want to set up a test function similar to others for validating backlog output. This involves creating a temporary path and running a subprocess command. I need to ensure that the history log behaves as expected. It seems the help command doesn't build a context when `args.command == help`, and I wonder if it records history despite that. I’ll have to verify these interactions more closely.
thinking
**Locating preamble function**

I'm considering if the help command needs to record history through `_format_pnpm_make_preamble`. I think it would make sense to find out where `_format_pnpm_make_preamble` is located in the command-line interface. I'll search for that function to better understand its role and see if it indeed interacts with history logging. This could clarify how help commands maintain their history and how it connects to the overall functionality.

**Considering parity diff**

I’m thinking about running the parity diff again with the same PH_ROOT. In the previous script, I printed the PH_ROOT path, but I didn’t save it. I could rerun the full parity diff step, which might require doing a pnpm install again, though caching could help mitigate that. 

Acceptance doesn’t need minimization, but I could re-run steps 3-5 using the same PH_ROOT if I had saved the path. Ultimately, I’ll just list the commands executed and run the same script again, expecting no diff this time.

**Updating steps in progress**

The diff command produced no output, which indicates a match and means step 2 is complete. Now, it looks like I need to plan for step 3, but actually, I’ve already implemented those fixes and tests. So, I’ll mark step 3 as completed. However, I have to be careful not to skip ahead. I’ll update everything accordingly: step 2 completed, step 3 completed, and now I’m moving on to step 4.
Plan update
Legacy vs `ph` stdout now matches for `help backlog`; added an exact-output pytest to lock it in.
  ✓ Scan current help backlog implementation
  ✓ Run legacy vs ph parity diff
  ✓ Implement fixes and tests
  → Run ruff and pytest verification
  • Update bookkeeping and commit
  • Write untracked done marker

**Running checks sequentially**

I'm planning to run `uv run ruff check .` followed by `uv run pytest -q`. I know that in the approval policy, we can’t run commands simultaneously, which makes sense. It might be better to run them sequentially to see the outputs clearly. I'll start with `ruff` and then move on to `pytest`. It's all about keeping things organized and ensuring everything is checked properly!
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'uv run ruff check .' in /Users/spensermcconnell/__Active_Code/project-handbook-cli succeeded in 107ms:
All checks passed!

**Updating bookkeeping**

I need to update my bookkeeping and commit my changes. Step 5 involves updating the status in tasks_v1_parity.json to "done" and including a completed_at timestamp in UTC ISO format. I also need to append a session log for V1P-0006 with the inputs and outputs reviewed, as well as the commands executed. I should open several files, including `cli_plan/AI_AGENT_START_HERE.md`, and the others listed, to ensure I’m covering all requirements accurately. Opening those up with quick commands like "sed head" sounds good!

Files changed (exact paths):
- cli_plan/session_logs.md
- cli_plan/tasks_v1_parity.json
- src/ph/help_text.py
- tests/test_help_topics.py

Verification:
- `diff -u /tmp/legacy-help-release.txt /tmp/ph-help-release.txt` returned no diff (byte-for-byte match).
- `uv run ruff check .` (pass)
- `uv run pytest -q` (pass)

Outcome:
- status: done
- summary: `ph --root <PH_ROOT> help release` now matches legacy `pnpm make -- help release` stdout byte-for-byte; parity locked via pytest.

Next task:
- V1P-0006

**Checking task status and next steps**

I need to ensure that the status is marked as done and summarize it. The next task should be computed after filling in the stub at the end. It looks like V1P-0007 might be the next task, but the user didn't mention that. According to the previous logs, V1P-0006 follows V1P-0005, so I'll check the tasks file for clarity. I'll update the status and compute the next task, but stay focused on V1P-0006.
thinking
**Determining next task and updates**

It looks like it would be better to list “V1P-0007” as the next task if that's the pending item, even though it connects to another ID. They asked for the computed next task, likely using an algorithm. I can mention the next task ID without actually working on it. To avoid scope creep, I’ll compute the next task from the JSON and confirm the lowest order pending task, likely V1P-0007. I also need to update the status for V1P-0006 and review relevant documentation.
thinking
**Reviewing relevant files**

To be honest, I really should open the relevant sections of those files. I'll run a search for "make help backlog" in the CLI_CONTRACT file. Using `rg -n` will help me locate the specific sections quickly. Once I find them, I can open the files and extract the necessary information. I want to ensure I have all the important details at hand! So, let's get that search started!
exec
/bin/zsh -lc 'rg -n "make help backlog|help backlog" cli_plan/PARITY_CHECKLIST.md cli_plan/v1_cli/CLI_CONTRACT.md' in /Users/spensermcconnell/__Active_Code/project-handbook-cli succeeded in 60ms:

cli_plan/v1_cli/CLI_CONTRACT.md:258:- `ph help backlog`

- `ph reset` (dry-run only)
- `ph reset --confirm RESET --force true` (execute)

Behavior:
- Reset of project handbook content artifacts.
- MUST preserve `.project-handbook/**`.
- Writes rewritten templates (roadmap, index.json stubs) as per reset spec.

Hook notes:
- On success, MUST skip the post-command hook entirely (no history, no auto-validation) to avoid additional side effects during destructive maintenance.
- Must still be safe-by-default.

Hints:
- In dry-run, print delete set + “how to execute”.
- On execute, print `✅ Reset complete.`

# CLI Parity Checklist (Make → `ph`)

This checklist is the **exhaustive parity verification** for the Make-to-CLI mapping defined in `cli_plan/v1_cli/CLI_CONTRACT.md` (“Make-to-CLI mapping (exhaustive)”).

## Conventions

- Prefer running against a disposable copy of the handbook repo.
- Use explicit root selection for determinism: `ph --root <PH_ROOT> ...`
- Output paths are **PH_ROOT-relative** (POSIX style).
- This checklist targets the reference Make interface in `/Users/spensermcconnell/__Active_Code/oss-saas/project-handbook` (invoked as `pnpm make -- <target>` or `make <target>`).

**Fixing indentation and timestamps**

I noticed that there's inconsistent indentation in the entry, particularly with a tab character at line 224. However, I want to keep things minimal. I'll patch only the relevant fields from lines 229-233. I need to set the status to "done" and add the timestamp for when it's completed, using UTC ISO format. To do that, I’ll use the date command and run `date -u +"%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%SZ"` to get the current time.

**Updating task log**

I'm planning to use the timestamp for tasks and the session log. The stub start time is 21:43, and I've completed it at 21:50:59Z. I need to patch the tasks file by changing the status to "done" and adding the completed_at key with that timestamp, either after started_at or status. In other tasks, the order is status, started_at, and then completed_at. I'll make sure to follow this structure and apply the patch accordingly.

 Goal:
+Match legacy `pnpm make -- help backlog` stdout byte-for-byte via `ph --root <PH_ROOT> help backlog`.
 
 Work performed (ordered):
-1.
+1. Captured legacy stdout for `help backlog` (and `help-backlog`) against a disposable `PH_ROOT`.
+2. Captured `ph` stdout for `help backlog` against the same `PH_ROOT` and diffed outputs.
+3. Updated `src/ph/help_text.py` backlog topic to mirror legacy `make backlog-*` help text.
+4. Added a deterministic pytest asserting exact stdout for `ph help backlog`.

**Updating progress plan**

I’m working on updating my plan: I’ve completed step four, which is great! Now, I’m focusing on step five. I want to make sure everything is smooth and organized as I move forward. It's always a bit of a challenge, but I'm determined to keep things on track. Let’s see how this step goes and what I can accomplish!
Plan update
Local lint/tests are green; next update bookkeeping and make the required single atomic commit.
  ✓ Scan current help backlog implementation
  ✓ Run legacy vs ph parity diff
  ✓ Implement fixes and tests
  ✓ Run ruff and pytest verification
  → Update bookkeeping and commit
  • Write untracked done marker

 Goal:
+Match legacy `pnpm make -- help backlog` stdout byte-for-byte via `ph --root <PH_ROOT> help backlog`.
 
 Work performed (ordered):
-1.
+1. Captured legacy stdout for `help backlog` (and `help-backlog`) against a disposable `PH_ROOT`.
+2. Captured `ph` stdout for `help backlog` against the same `PH_ROOT` and diffed outputs.
+3. Updated `src/ph/help_text.py` backlog topic to mirror legacy `make backlog-*` help text.
+4. Added a deterministic pytest asserting exact stdout for `ph help backlog`.

**Considering logs and commits**

I’m noticing there are untracked .codex-agent logs and PID files, and prior markers. It seems important not to commit .codex-agent or marker files. Should I remove those logs and PID files? The user didn't specifically mention them, but it might be cleaner to keep things tidy. I realize these untracked artifacts won’t get included in the commit, but I wonder if I should mention them in the final report. I'll focus on staging only the four modified files I need.

 Goal:
+Match legacy `pnpm make -- help backlog` stdout byte-for-byte via `ph --root <PH_ROOT> help backlog`.
 
 Work performed (ordered):
-1.
+1. Captured legacy stdout for `help backlog` (and `help-backlog`) against a disposable `PH_ROOT`.
+2. Captured `ph` stdout for `help backlog` against the same `PH_ROOT` and diffed outputs.
+3. Updated `src/ph/help_text.py` backlog topic to mirror legacy `make backlog-*` help text.
+4. Added a deterministic pytest asserting exact stdout for `ph help backlog`.

thinking
I need to ensure that tasks.json and session logs are committed. Good, it shows that 4 files changed, which should include the tasks and session files. Now, I want to create a marker file named `ph-parity-V1P-0006.done`. This file should remain untracked, so I can create it now. After that, I'll update the plan to reflect that step 5 is complete and that I'm moving on to step 6. But first, I should check the git status again.

**Creating marker file**

Alright, it seems there are no modified tracked files, which is a relief. Now, I need to write a marker file. I'll use `printf` to output to the file, and I think including a timestamp or summary is a good idea. It’s untracked, so I can create it without worrying about version control issues. This feels like a straightforward task, but I want to ensure everything goes smoothly!
exec
/bin/zsh -lc "printf \"%s\\n\" \"done\" > ph-parity-V1P-0006.done" in /Users/spensermcconnell/__Active_Code/project-handbook-cli succeeded in 46ms:

 Goal:
+Match legacy `pnpm make -- help backlog` stdout byte-for-byte via `ph --root <PH_ROOT> help backlog`.
 
 Work performed (ordered):
-1.
+1. Captured legacy stdout for `help backlog` (and `help-backlog`) against a disposable `PH_ROOT`.
+2. Captured `ph` stdout for `help backlog` against the same `PH_ROOT` and diffed outputs.
+3. Updated `src/ph/help_text.py` backlog topic to mirror legacy `make backlog-*` help text.
+4. Added a deterministic pytest asserting exact stdout for `ph help backlog`.

 Goal:
+Match legacy `pnpm make -- help backlog` stdout byte-for-byte via `ph --root <PH_ROOT> help backlog`.
 
 Work performed (ordered):
-1.
+1. Captured legacy stdout for `help backlog` (and `help-backlog`) against a disposable `PH_ROOT`.
+2. Captured `ph` stdout for `help backlog` against the same `PH_ROOT` and diffed outputs.
+3. Updated `src/ph/help_text.py` backlog topic to mirror legacy `make backlog-*` help text.
+4. Added a deterministic pytest asserting exact stdout for `ph help backlog`.

**Checking git status**

I'm considering ensuring that the marker file is untracked by using `git status`. This step makes sense since I want to keep things organized. If the file shows up in the changes, it could cause confusion later. So, I’ll double-check the status to see if the marker file is correctly untracked. If it’s tracked by mistake, I’ll need to take the necessary steps to fix that. It's all about keeping my workflow tidy!

 Goal:
+Match legacy `pnpm make -- help backlog` stdout byte-for-byte via `ph --root <PH_ROOT> help backlog`.
 
 Work performed (ordered):
-1.
+1. Captured legacy stdout for `help backlog` (and `help-backlog`) against a disposable `PH_ROOT`.
+2. Captured `ph` stdout for `help backlog` against the same `PH_ROOT` and diffed outputs.
+3. Updated `src/ph/help_text.py` backlog topic to mirror legacy `make backlog-*` help text.
+4. Added a deterministic pytest asserting exact stdout for `ph help backlog`.
